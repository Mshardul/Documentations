## Level 1

- surface-level realizations
- focuses on relatable human experiences that spark mild anxiety about isolation and uncertainty.

### Everyone has their own complex life

#### What is it?

- Often referred to as **"Sonder"** - sudden realization that you are not the main character of reality. Your ae an extra in the Background of Billions of other films.
- Every stranger has a life as vivid, traumatic, and complex as yours - with their inside jokes, heartbreaks, and favorite spoon

#### Examples

- Traffic Jam: Look at hundreds of cars around you -> realizing every single driver is late for something specific - a job interview, a divorce hearing, or a child's recital -> you are just "traffic" to them.
- High-Rise Window: Seeing a lit window in a distant skyscraper at 2AM -> realizing someone is awake inside - perhaps crying, working or falling in love - completely disconnected from your existence.
- Background Crows: Watching old news footage -> realizing every blurred face in the background had a name, a family, a death -> they are all gone now.

#### Quotes

- "Everyone is necessarily the hero of his own life story" - John Barth

#### Symptoms

- sudden feeling of insignificance
- "statistical drowning" - feeling overwhelmed by the sheer volume of human experience.

#### Cure

- Lean into it. Sonder kills ego.
- If you are just a background character to them, then your embarrassing mistakes don't matter because they aren't paying attention to you.

#### Related Topics

- **Dunbar's Number**: We can only maintain ~150 stable relationships. To function, we must dehumanize strangers into "background noise" or we would emotionally collapse.
- **Solipsism**: The opposite fear - that only your mind is real and everyone else is a robot.

#### Resources

- Book: "Mrs. Dalloway" by "Virginia Woolf" (jumping between the inner consciousness of strangers passing on the street)
- Video: "Sonder" by "The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows"

#### Thought-Provoking Questions

- If you could instantly download a stranger's entire life memory into your brain, would you do it? or would the weight of 2 lives crush you?
- Whose story are you the "villain" in right now, probably even without knowing it?

### Worry about the Future

#### What is it?

- This is the evolutionary "glitch" of the human frontal lobe.
- Humans are the only animals capable fo running complex simulations of the future.
- While this can be highly useful in various scenarios, it also means we suffer misfortunes in our heads thousands of times before they happen (or even if they never happen).

#### Examples

- The Sunday Scaries: Ruining comfortable Sunday afternoon by mentally living through the stress of Monday Morning meeings.
- Retirement Math: A 25-year-old stressing about whether they will have enough money at age 85 - suffering for a version of themselves that doesn't exist yet.
- The Phantom Diagnosis: Finding a small bump on your arm and spending 3 hours researching rare cancers - living through the grief of a terminal illness that you do not have.

#### Quotes

- "I am an old man and have known a great many troubles, but most of them never happened" - Mark Twain
- "We suffer more often in imagination that in reality" - Seneca

#### Symptoms

- Chronic Anxiety, Inability to Act, Doomscrolling
  
#### Reasoning

- We live in a "Delayed Return Environment", while our brains evolved for immediate returns - Our anxiety engine is revving for a tiger attack, but we are just sitting at a desk.

#### Cure

- Mindfulness/Presence: Anxiety cannot exist in the "present moment", as it is a calculation of the future. Focus entire on the sensation of your feet on the floor, the simulation stops.

#### Related Topics

- **The Hedonic Treadmill**: The tendency to return to a baseline level of happiness regardless of future success of failure.
- **Opportunity Cost**: The paralyzing fear that by choosing one future, you are "killing" all other possible futures.

#### Resources for Deeper Understanding

- Book: "The Wisdom of Insecurity" by "Alan Watts" (argues that chasing security in the future is what kills the present)
- Book: "Stumbling on Happiness" by "Daniel Gilbert" (explains why our brains are terrible at predicting what will make our future selves happy)

#### Thought-Provoking Questions

- If you were given an option of knowing the exact date and cause of your death, would be like to know?
- Think of a "crisis" you worried about 5 yrs ago. Does it still matter today? If not, why are you treating today's crisis as if it will matter in 5 yrs?

## Level 2

### Simulation theory

#### What is it?

- posists that if humanity (or any other civilization) ever reaches a "post-human" stage where they have vast computing power, they will likely run "ancestor simulations".
- if they run millions of these, then statistically, you are almost certainly living in one of the millions of simulations, not the one single "base reality".
- Popularized by philosopher Nick Bostrom

#### Examples

- Glitches in Reality: The sensation of Deja Vu (feeling like you have lived a moment before) is often jokingly referred to as a "glitch in the Matrix" - a memory file being written twice.
- The Double-Slit Experiment: In Physics, particles behave differently when they are being observed versus when they are not. This mimics how video games save memory by only rendering the graphics that the player is currently looking at.
- The Goldilocks Zone: The universe has physical constants (gravity, speed of light) that are so precisely tuned for life that if they are altered by even the slightest, the universe wouldn't work. It feels "programmed" for us.

#### Quotes

- "There's a one in Billions chance we are in base reality" - Elon Musk
- "If you are living in a simulation, then everything you are is just information" - Nick Bostrom
- "I think, therefore I am" - Rene Descartes

#### Symptoms

- **Derealization**: a feeling that the world around you is "foggy", fake, or 2-dimensional.

#### Reasoning

- If creating a realistic simulation is possible, and if civilizations survive long enough to do it, then fake universes will outnumber real ones.

#### Cure

- Pragmatism: Even if this is a simulation, the pain you feel is "real" to you. The laws of this simulation still apply to your "avatar".

#### Related Topics

- **Last Thursdayism**: The idea that the universe was created last Thursday with false memories implanted.
- **Solipsism**: The belief that you are the only real conscious being.

#### Resources

- Paper: "Are you living in a Computer Simulation?" by "Nick Bostrom
- Movie: The Matrix or The Thirteenth Floor

#### Thought-Provoking Questions

- if you found out that you were in a simulation, and your "purpose" was just to be a background character in someone else's story, what would you do?
- is a simulated feeling of love "fake"? if your brain releases the exact same chemicals, does the origin of the stimulus matter?

### Why does anything exist?

#### What is it?

- often called the "Contingency of Being"
- Logic suggest that "nothing" is the natural state of things - it requires no energy, no lasw, and no space.
- The fact that a massive, complex universe exsists instead of a void is a violation of Occam's Razor.
- It is the ultimate Brute fact that has no explanation.

#### Examples

- The Concept of Zero: In Maths, we have a number for "nothing" (0), but in the physical world, true "nothingness" is impossible to find. Even a vacuum has quantum fluctuation.
- The Big Bang: Science explains how the Universe expanded, but it cannot explain what banged or why? It hits a wall where Physics break down.
- Your Own Consciousness: Why is there a "you" inside?

#### Quotes

- "Why is there something rather than nothing?" — Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz
- "The universe is just there, and that's all." — Bertrand Russell
- "Not how the world is, is the mystical, but that it is." — Ludwig Wittgenstein

#### Symptoms

- **Vertigo**: A sudden dizzying sensation when you look at your hand or a tree and realize how absurd it is that matter is just floating here.

#### Reasoning

- Humans are causality machines; we look for the "cause" of everything.
- But the Universe (the set of all things) cannot have a cause outside of itself - because then that cause would be part of the universe).
- This creates a logic loop our brains cannot handle.

#### Cure

- **Radical Acceptance (Camus' Absurdism)**: Accept that the universe is irrational and silent. It does not owe you an explanation. You must create your own meaning in the face of this silence.

#### Related Topics

- **The Cosmological Argument**: The religious argument that there must be a "First Cause" (God).
- **The Anthropic Principle**: The idea that the universe exists this way because if it didn't, we wouldn't be here to ask the question.

#### Resources for Deeper Understanding

- Book: "Why Does the World Exist?" by "Jim Holt" (A detective story interviewing physicists and philosophers).
- Video: "The Egg" by "Kurzgesagt" (A poetic take on existence).

#### Thought-Provoking Questions

- Can you imagine "Nothing"? Try to visualize it. (Note: Blackness ins't nothingness).
- If the universe had a clear, written purpose, would you actually feel better or enslaved?

### Acknowledgement of Death

#### What is it?

- refers to Terror Management Theory (TMT).
- psychological realization that most of human culture (religion, art, skyscrapers, having children) is driven by a subconscious, paralyzing fear of easing to exist.
- We spend our lives building "immortality projects" to prove we are more than just meat that will rot.

#### Examples

- **Legacy Building**: Billionaires putting their names on libraries or rockets - so their name outlives their body.
- **Mid-Life Crisis**: Buying a sports car - panic response to realizing the "sand in the hourglass" is half gone.

#### Quotes

- "The idea of death, the fear of it, haunts the human animal like nothing else; it is a mainspring of human activity." — Ernest Becker
- "Men are so necessarily mad, that not to be mad would amount to another form of madness." - Blaise Pascal
- "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work; I want to achieve immortality by not dying." — Woody Allen

#### Symptoms

- A sudden loss of motivation - "Why do this if I am going to be dead in 40 years?"

#### Reasoning

- Our survival instinct drives us to stay alive, but our intellect guarantees we will die.
- This friction creates cognitive dissonance, which we solve by deluding ourselves that we are "important" or "eternal."

#### Cure

- **Memento Mori** (Remember you must die) - The Stoics argued that keeping death close makes life sweeter.

#### Related Topics

- **Nihilism**: The belief that because death erases everything, nothing matters.
- **Ego Death**: The deliberate dissolution of the self (often through meditation or psychedelics) to practice "dying" before you die.

#### Resources for Deeper Understanding

- Book: "The Denial of Death" by "Ernest Becker" (The seminal psychology text on this topic).
- YouTube Channel: "Pursuit of Wonder" (Often deals with TMT and existential dread).

#### Thought-Provoking Questions

- If you were immortal, would you get out of bed tomorrow? Without the deadline of death, would any action have urgency or meaning?
- What is one "Immortality Project" you are currently working on (a child, a book, a career, a social media profile)? Admit to yourself that it is a shield against death.

## Level 3

- we stop looking at the world as a shared experience

### Sympathy is created by self-pity

#### What is it?
- a cynical but psychologically grounded theory (often linked to Psychological Egoism).
- argues that true altruism is impossible.
- When you feel "sad" for a homeless person, you aren't actually feeling their pain. You are imagining yourself in their position and feeling pity for that hypothetical version of you.
- All empathy is just a selfish fear of personal suffering.

#### Examples

- **The Crying Moviegoer**: You cry when a character dies - not because you care about the fictional person, but because if triggers your own fear of losing a loved one.
- **Disaster Relief**: Donations often spike for disasters that could "happen to anyone" (hurricanes) vs. chronic issues (famine), because donors can more easily visualize themselves in the hurricane.
- **"I know how you feel"**: A phrase that is technically a lie. You only know how you felt when something similar happened to you.

#### Quotes

- "We do not love people so much for the good they have done us, as for the good we have done them." — Leo Tolstoy (War and Peace).
- "Self-love is the instrument of our preservation... it resembles the instrument of the perpetuation of the species." — Voltaire

#### Symptoms

- **Imposter Syndrome in Good Deeds**: Feeling guilty after helping someone because you wonder, "Did I do this just to feel like a good person?"

#### Reasoning

- Humans are biological survival machines.
- Evolutionarily, it makes no sense to waste energy on non-kin unless it buys us social credit or alleviates our own distress.

#### Cure

- **Reframing**: Does the motivation matter if the outcome is good? If "selfish" empathy leads to feeding the hungry, then selfishness is a useful tool.
    - As Kant argued, duty is what matters, not just the feeling.

#### Related Topics

- **Psychological Egoism**: The theory that humans are always motivated by self-interest.
- **Virtue Signaling**: Doing good deeds solely for social status.

#### Resources for Deeper Understanding

- Book: "The Selfish Gene" by "Richard Dawkins" (Explores how altruism is just genes trying to survive).
- Video: "Friends" - The episode where Phoebe tries to find a "selfless good deed."

#### Thought-Provoking Questions

- Think of the kindest thing you ever did. Dig deep: Did you do it for them, or for the warm glow of feeling moral?
- If you could save a child's life anonymously (no one would ever know), or save a dog's life and be famous for it, which would you honestly choose?

### Last Thursday-ism

#### What is it?

- The hypothesis that the universe was created last Thursday (or 5 minutes ago), complete with false memories, aged buildings, and fossils in the ground.
- Because an omnipotent creator could create a "mature" universe, there is no way to prove the past actually happened.

#### Examples

- **The Video Game Load**: When you load a save file in a game, the world appears instantly "old" with history, even though it was generated that second.
- **False Memories**: Studies show people can be easily convinced they were lost in a mall as a child (when they weren't), proving our "past" is editable.
- **Carbon Dating**: If a tree was created 5 minutes ago with 100 rings inside it, science would incorrectly date it as 100 years old.

#### Quotes

- "The past has no existence except as a record in the present." — Bertrand Russell
- "If the world was created 5 minutes ago, how would you know? You wouldn't. Your breakfast is just a memory implanted to give you continuity." — Vsauce
- "Time is a river which sweeps me along, but I am the river." — Jorge Luis Borges

#### Symptoms

- **Paranoia about Memory**: Starting to doubt if your childhood friends actually exist or if they are just backstory characters.

#### Reasoning

- an unfalsifiable claim: Logic cannot defeat it because any "proof" (photos, diaries) could also have been created last Thursday.

#### Cure

- **Occam's Razor**:
    - It is technically possible, but it requires massive, unnecessary complexity.
    - It is simpler to assume the past is real.
    - If the fake past is indistinguishable from a real past, you might as well treat it as real.

#### Related Topics

- **Omphalos Hypothesis**: The theological argument that God created Adam with a belly button (suggesting a birth that never happened) to make him "complete."
- **Boltzmann Brains**: (A deeper version of this concept).

#### Related Resources

- Video: "Last Thursdayism" by "Vsauce" (YouTube).
- Short Story: "The Jester" by "Michael J. Sullivan" (Touches on the pliability of reality)

#### Thought-Provoking Questions

- What is one memory you have that feels "realer" than the rest? Why do you trust it?
- If you knew for a fact the world started this morning, would you still pay your debts?

### Your are alone in your brain

#### What is it?

- realization of Epistemic Isolation.
- You can never truly know another person. You only know your perception of them.
- You can never prove anyone else is conscious; they could be "Philosophical Zombies" (beings that act human but have no inner experience).

#### Examples

- **The Color Red**: I can point to a strawberry and say "Red," and you agree. But inside your mind, "Red" might look like my "Blue." We can never check.
- **Pain Scale**: A doctor asks "Rate your pain 1-10." This is meaningless because my 10 might be your 4. We have no shared unit of feeling.
- **The "NPC" feeling**: Walking through a crowded airport and feeling like everyone else is just automated scenery.

#### Quotes

- "Hell is other people." — Jean-Paul Sartre
- "I exist, that is all, and I find it nauseating." — Jean-Paul Sartre
- "We are like islands in the sea, separate on the surface but connected in the deep." — William James

#### Symptom

- **Profound Loneliness**: The realization that no matter how much you love someone, you will never be them. There is always a wall.

#### Reasoning

- Consciousness is subjective. Science studies the objective. Therefore, science cannot bridge the gap between two minds.

#### Cure

- **Communication as Art**: We can't share minds, but we can build bridges (language, art, touch). The attempt to cross the gap is what gives life meaning, even if we never fully succeed.

#### Related Topics

- **Qualia**: The subjective "feeling" of an experience (the redness of red).
- **The Beetle in a Box**: Wittgenstein's thought experiment about how we can never know what word actually refers to inside someone else's head.

#### Related Resources

- Book: "Nausea" by "Jean-Paul Sartre"
- Video: "The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows" by "Exulansis"

#### Thought-Provoking Questions

- Try to describe the taste of salt to someone without using the word "salty" or comparing it to another food. (It’s impossible, showing the limits of shared language).
- Does it matter if your best friend is a robot, as long as they treat you well?

### We are not alone

#### What is it?

- If we aren't alone, that might be worse
- Dark Forest Theory
    - from Liu Cixin
    - suggests the universe is full of life, but it is silent because everyone is hiding. Any civilization that reveals itself (like Earth is doing) is instantly destroyed by advanced predators.

#### Examples

- **Predator/Prey**: In a jungle night, the smart animals are silent. Only the foolish ones make noise.
- **Indigenous Contact**: Historically, whenever a less advanced civilization met a more advanced one, it didn't end well for the locals.
- **Radio Silence**: We have been broadcasting radio for 100 years. If anyone was listening, the "missile" might already be on its way (at light speed).

#### Quotes

- "Two possibilities exist: either we are alone in the Universe or we are not. Both are equally terrifying." — Arthur C. Clarke
- "The universe is a dark forest... If a hunter sees another life, he can do only one thing: shoot and eliminate them." — Liu Cixin
- "If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didn't turn out well for the Native Americans." — Stephen Hawking

#### Symptom

- **Xenophobia/Cosmic Dread**: Fear of the night sky.

#### Reasoning

- It’s a **Game Theory trap**: You can't trust the other civilization is peaceful, so the safest move is always to shoot first.

#### Cure

- **Optimism**: This assumes aliens think like humans (conquerors).
    - Advanced intelligence might evolve past violence.

#### Related Topics

- **Fermi Paradox**: "Where is everybody?"
- **The Great Filter**: The barrier that stops life from becoming interstellar.

#### Related Resources

- Book: "The Dark Forest" by "Liu Cixin" (Sci-fi horror masterpiece)
- Video: "The Dark Forest Theory" by "Kurzgesagt"

#### Thought-Provoking Questions

- Should humanity stop broadcasting messages into space? Why or why not?
- If you were an alien and saw Earth (violent, chaotic), would you say hello or would you destroy us for safety?

### Afterlife Skepticism

#### What is it?

- This is the **materialist hard-stop**: The view that consciousness is purely a byproduct of the brain's chemistry.
    - When the brain dies, the "show" doesn't move to a new theater; the projector just breaks.
    - There is no darkness, no waiting—just non-existence.

#### Examples

- **Anesthesia**: You go under, and then you wake up. There was no "time" in between. Death is just the "going under" without the "waking up."
- **Pre-Birth**: You were "dead" for 13.8 billion years before you were born. It didn't hurt.
- **Brain Damage**: When people suffer brain damage, they lose parts of their personality. If damaging the hardware deletes the software bit by bit, destroying the hardware should delete the software completely.

#### Quotes

- "I was dead for millions of years before I was born and it never inconvenienced me a bit." — Mark Twain
- "Death is nothing to us. When we exist, death is not; and when death exists, we are not." — Epicurus
- "For in that sleep of death what dreams may come..." — Shakespeare (Hamlet)

#### Symptom

- **Nihilistic Panic**: If this is it, the pressure to "be happy" becomes unbearable.

#### Reasoning

- We have zero evidence of consciousness existing without a brain.

#### Cure

- **Urgency**: If there is no afterlife, this life becomes infinitely precious. It is the only chance you get.
    - "YOLO" is actually a profound philosophical stance.

#### Related Topics

- **Epicureanism**: Philosophy that argues pleasure is the highest good and death is not to be feared.
- **Pascal's Wager**: The argument that it is safer to believe in God just in case.

#### Related Resources

- Book: "Nothing to Be Frightened Of" by "Julian Barnes".
- Video: "Shelly Kagan's Yale Course" on "Death" (available on YouTube).

#### Thought-Provoking Questions

- If you knew this was the only life, would you work harder or relax more?
- Does the concept of "eternal nothingness" scare you more or less than "eternal life" (living forever without end)?

## Level 4

- tipping point where isolation turns into emptiness
- We move from questioning if things are real to confronting the possibility that even if they are, they are fundamentally meaningless.

### Nihilism

#### What is it?

- the philosophical rejection of objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value.
- It posits that the universe does not care about you, morality is a human invention, and there is no "grand plan."
- While often seen as depressing, it can also be liberating (Optimistic Nihilism)—if nothing matters, you are free to assign your own meaning to life.

#### Examples

- **Cosmic Scale**: The universe is 93 billion light-years wide. A human life lasts 0.0000001% of cosmic history.
- **Moral Relativism**: In nature, a lion eating a gazelle isn't "evil," it's just lunch. Humans created the concepts of "good" and "evil"; the universe only has physics.
- **The Heat Death**: Eventually, all stars will die, and the universe will be a cold, dark void forever. Nothing we build will survive this end.


#### Quotes

- "God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him." — Friedrich Nietzsche
- "Man is the only creature who refuses to be what he is." — Albert Camus
- "If we believe in nothing, if nothing has any meaning and if we can affirm no values whatsoever, then everything is possible and nothing has any importance." - Albert Camus (The Rebel)

#### Symptom

- **Existential Ennui**: A deep, unshakeable boredom or feeling that efforts are futile.
    - "Why wash the dishes if they just get dirty again?" applied to life itself.

#### Reasoning

- **Scientific materialism** strips away magic/divinity, leaving only cold mechanism.
    - Without a "God" or "Fate," meaning evaporates.

#### Cure

- **Existentialism/Absurdism**: Admit life has no inherent meaning, then revolt by creating your own.
    - You wash the dishes not because the universe cares, but because you prefer clean plates.

#### Related Topics

- **Optimistic Nihilism**: Since nothing matters, you are free from pressure and can simply enjoy the ride of existence.
- **Absurdism**: The conflict between the human search for meaning and the universe's refusal to provide it.

#### Related Resources

- Video: "Optimistic Nihilism" by "Kurzgesagt" (A vital watch to flip the script on dread).
- Book: "The Stranger" by "Albert Camus" (A short novel about a man who refuses to pretend life has meaning).

#### Thought-Provoking Questions

- If you knew the world would end in exactly 100 years, making all legacy impossible, how would you change your life today?
- Is a "meaningless" happiness (like playing video games) less valuable than a "meaningful" struggle (like raising a child)? Why?


### We are alone

#### What is it?

- inverse of the "Dark Forest" fear.
- Instead of being hunted, we are terrified by the silence.
- If the "Great Filter" (climate change, nuclear war) kills 99.9% of civilizations, and we passed it, we might be the only conscious observers in the entire universe.
- We are the universe's only way of looking at itself.

#### Examples

- **The Rare Earth Hypothesis**: The specific conditions for life (Jupiter shielding us from asteroids, a large moon stabilizing our tilt) are so rare they might happen only once.
- **The Pale Blue Dot**: Looking at the famous photo of Earth from Saturn - a tiny pixel in a sunbeam - and realizing no help is coming from elsewhere.
- **Abandoned Places**: The eerie feeling of walking through an empty city (like during COVID lockdowns). Amplify that feeling to a galactic scale.

#### Quotes

- "We are the local eyes and ears and thoughts and feelings of the cosmos." — Carl Sagan
- "Sometimes I think we're alone in the universe, and sometimes I think we're not. In either case the idea is quite staggering." — Arthur C. Clarke
- "The silence of these infinite spaces frightens me." — Blaise Pascal\

#### Symptom

- **Crushing Responsibility**: If we die, the universe goes blind.
    - Art, music, and love disappear from reality entirely.

#### Reasoning

- We have scanned the skies for decades and found nothing.
- No Dyson spheres, no radio signals. Just static.

#### Cure

- **Stewardship**: Instead of feeling lonely, feel important.
    - We are the "Guardians of the Flame" - We must survive because we carry the only light.

#### Related Topics

- **The Rare Earth Hypothesis**: The theory that complex life is exceptionally rare due to specific astrophysical requirements.
- **The Great Filter**: A hypothetical event in evolutionary history that wipes out civilizations before they become interstellar.

#### Related Resources

- Video: "Life Beyond 3: In Search of Giants" by "melodysheep" (Visually stunning exploration of why we might be alone).
- Book: "Pale Blue Dot" by "Carl Sagan" (Focuses on the fragility of our position in space).

#### Thought-Provoking Questions

- If we are truly the only intelligent life, does that make human life more valuable or just more tragic?
- Would you rather find a dead alien civilization (ruins) or find nothing at all? Which is scarier?

### Being born before immortality

#### What is it?

- A specifically modern form of dread. We are currently on the steep curve of exponential technological growth.
- Scientists predict we might cure aging or upload consciousness within 50-100 years.
- If you die at age 80, just a few years before the "cure" is released, you will be part of the last generation of humans that had to die involuntarily.

#### Examples

- **The "Last Man to Die" Syndrome**: Think of the soldier who died 1 minute before the Armistice was signed in WWI. It feels infinitely more tragic than dying in the middle of the war.
- **Longevity Escape Velocity**: The point where science adds more than 1 year of life expectancy for every year that passes. We are close, but maybe not close enough for you.
- **Cryonics Waitlists**: People signing up to be frozen not because they believe it works, but because it's a lottery ticket for a future they might miss by a decade.

#### Quotes

- "I plan to live forever, of course, but barring that I'd settle for a couple thousand years." — Isaac Asimov
- "The first person to live to be 1,000 years old is certainly alive today." — Aubrey de Grey (Biogerontologist)
- "Humanity is a bridge, not a destination." — Friedrich Nietzsche

#### Symptom

- **Health Anxiety/FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out)**: Obsession with supplements, AI news, and staying alive "just a little longer" to catch the singularity.

#### Reasoning

- **Progress is exponential**: The difference between 1900 and 2000 was massive. The difference between 2000 and 2100 will be god-like. We are right on the edge.

#### Cure

- **Acceptance of the Cycle**: Immortality might be a trap (boredom, stagnation). There is beauty in a complete narrative with an end.

#### Related Topics

- **Transhumanism**: The movement that advocates for the transformation of the human condition through technology.
- **Longevity Escape Velocity**: The theoretical point where medical progress extends life faster than aging shortens it.

#### Related Resources

- Book: "Superintelligence" by "Nick Bostrom" (Discusses the risks and rewards of the AI future we might miss).
- Video: "The Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant" by "CGP Grey" (An allegory arguing that death is a problem to be solved, not accepted).

#### Thought-Provoking Questions

- If you could upload your mind to a computer to live forever, but you had to destroy your biological body to do it, would you? (Is the copy you?)
- Would you be angry if your grandchildren were immortal, or would you be happy for them?
